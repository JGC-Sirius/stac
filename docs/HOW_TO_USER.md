# Hot to install and use STAC

## Install Java

[Download and install the latest version of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE).](https://www.java.com/de/download/manual.jsp)

## Installing STAC

STAC does not need to be installed via a setup.

Just unzip the downloaded file with your OS's default archive manager or software like WinRAR, 7-Zip or tar/untar.

[Optionally, you can add a link somewhere within your PATH to start STAC even faster.](../docs/HOW_TO_PATH.md)

## Starting STAC

If your JRE is set up correctly you can simply double click the extracted ```stac.jar```.

If for some reason this does not work, open a terminal at the path where ```stac.jar``` is located and start it with the call ```java -jar stac.jar```.

Alternatively, you can call stac by using ```Run -> stac``` or opening up a terminal and calling ```stac``` after following [this guide](../docs/HOW_TO_PATH.md).
